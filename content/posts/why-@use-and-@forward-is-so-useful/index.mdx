## Introduction

---

If you're a web developer or designer working with Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets), you've probably heard about the handy features `@use` and `@forward`. Introduced in Sass 3.9, these directives have become a game-changer for organising and managing styles in complex projects. In this blog post, we'll explore why @use and @forward are so useful and provide practical examples to demonstrate their power.

## Simplify Dependency Management

One of the primary advantages of @use and @forward is their ability to simplify the way you manage dependencies. In traditional Sass, the @import directive could lead to a tangled web of dependencies, resulting in bloated and hard-to-maintain codebases. @use, on the other hand, provides a clear way to import only the specific members (variables, mixins, and functions) you need from other Sass modules.

### Example:

Consider you have a color utilities module (_colors.scss) that defines various color variables, like $primary-color, $secondary-color, etc. Instead of importing the entire module with @import, you can selectively import just the required colors:

```{sass}
// _colors.scss
$primary-color: #007bff;
$secondary-color: #6c757d;
$tertiary-color: #28a745;
// ...

// main.scss
@use 'colors' with (
  $primary-color,
  $secondary-color
);

body {
  background-color: colors.$primary-color;
  color: colors.$secondary-color;
}
```

## Simplify Dependency Management

Modularising your Sass code is crucial for maintainability and reusability. The @use directive encourages this modular approach by creating namespaces for imported members, avoiding naming collisions and making your codebase more organised.

### Example:

Let's say you have a typography module (_typography.scss) with various typography-related mixins and functions. You can use @use to create a namespace for the typography module:

```{sass}
// _typography.scss
@mixin heading($size) {
  font-size: $size;
  // ...
}

// main.scss
@use 'typography' as typography;

h1 {
  @include typography.heading(24px);
}

h2 {
  @include typography.heading(20px);
}

```

## Facilitate Forwarding
@forward allows you to expose certain Sass members from one module to another, without having to re-implement them. This feature helps in building robust and composable APIs, making it easier for different parts of your codebase to communicate effectively.

Example:

Consider two separate modules: _buttons.scss and _forms.scss. If the buttons module has a useful mixin called .btn-primary, you can forward it to the forms module using @forward:

```{sass}
// _buttons.scss
@mixin btn-primary {
  // Button styles...
}

// _forms.scss
@forward 'buttons' show btn-primary;

// main.scss
@use 'forms';

.my-form {
  @include forms.btn-primary;
}
```

## Lets get slightly more complex

1. You have a folder structure with separate Sass files for each component (e.g., _navbar.scss, _buttons.scss, _basket.scss, _order.scss, _footer.scss, etc.).
2. You have a main.scss file that imports and uses these modules.

```{sass}
// _buttons.scss
// _colors.scss
$primary-color: #007bff;
$secondary-color: #6c757d;

// _buttons.scss
@mixin btn-primary {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  color: #ffffff;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 5px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

// _navbar.scss
.navbar {
  background-color: $secondary-color;
  // ...
}

// main.scss
@use 'colors';
@use 'buttons' as buttons;
@use 'navbar';

body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

.navbar {
  @include buttons.btn-primary;
}

```

## Encourage Modularisation:


```{sass}
// _typography.scss
@mixin heading($size) {
  font-size: $size;
  // ...
}

// _basket.scss
.basket {
  border: 1px solid $primary-color;
  // ...
}

// _order.scss
.order {
  background-color: $secondary-color;
  // ...
}

// main.scss
@use 'typography';
@use 'basket';
@use 'order';

.basket-name {
  @include typography.heading(18px);
}

.order-item {
  @include typography.heading(16px);
}
```

#### Facilitate Forwarding:

```{sass}
// _forms.scss
@forward 'buttons' show btn-primary;

// _footer.scss
@forward 'buttons' as footerButtons show btn-primary;

// main.scss
@use 'forms';
@use 'footer';

.my-form {
  @include forms.btn-primary;
}

.footer {
  @include footer.footerButtons;
}
```
## Conclusion:

In this more complex example, we have a comprehensive folder structure for our components, each managed in their respective Sass files. The @use and @forward directives enable us to selectively import the necessary styles and components from different modules, avoiding naming conflicts and keeping the codebase organized.

The color variables defined in _colors.scss are shared across various components, making it easy to maintain a consistent color scheme. The typography styles are separated into their own module, promoting reusability throughout the project.

The @forward directive also allows us to expose mixins from one module to another, enabling the sharing of common styles between different components. For example, the .btn-primary mixin from _buttons.scss is used in both the _forms.scss and _footer.scss modules, eliminating the need for code duplication.

In conclusion, @use and @forward play a vital role in simplifying, modularizing, and reusing styles in more complex Sass projects, ultimately leading to a cleaner and more efficient codebase. As projects grow in size and complexity, harnessing the power of these directives becomes increasingly crucial to maintainable and scalable stylesheets.
